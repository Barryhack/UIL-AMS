   - Add this URL to Additional Board Manager URLs:
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
   - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
   - Search for "ESP32" and install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"

2. WiFi Library:
   - Built-in with ESP32 package (no installation needed)

3. WebServer Library:
   - Built-in with ESP32 package (no installation needed)

4. ArduinoJson:
   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
   - Search for "ArduinoJson"
   - Install "ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon" (version 6.x recommended)

5. SD Library:
   - Built-in with Arduino IDE (no installation needed)

6. SPI Library:
   - Built-in with Arduino IDE (no installation needed)

7. Wire Library:
   - Built-in with Arduino IDE (no installation needed)

8. Adafruit GFX Library:
   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
   - Search for "Adafruit GFX"
   - Install "Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit"

9. Adafruit SSD1306:
   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
   - Search for "Adafruit SSD1306"
   - Install "Adafruit SSD1306 by Adafruit"

10. MFRC522 (for RFID):
    - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
    - Search for "MFRC522"
    - Install "MFRC522 by GithubCommunity"

11. Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library:
    - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
    - Search for "Adafruit Fingerprint"
    - Install "Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library by Adafruit"

Board Configuration:
===================
- Board: "ESP32 Dev Module"
- Upload Speed: "921600"
- CPU Frequency: "240MHz (WiFi/BT)"
- Flash Frequency: "80MHz"
- Flash Mode: "QIO"
- Flash Size: "4MB (32Mb)"
- Partition Scheme: "Default 4MB with spiffs"
- Core Debug Level: "None"
- PSRAM: "Disabled"

Troubleshooting:
===============
1. If compilation fails with "library not found":
   - Restart Arduino IDE after installing libraries
   - Check that all libraries are installed correctly

2. If upload fails:
   - Hold the BOOT button on ESP32 while uploading
   - Check the correct COM port is selected
   - Try reducing upload speed to 115200

3. If WiFi connection fails:
   - Double-check SSID and password in the code
   - Ensure the WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)

4. If sensors don't work:
   - Verify all pin connections match the code
   - Check power supply (3.3V vs 5V requirements)
   - Use a multimeter to verify connections

Hardware Connections:
====================
Refer to the pin definitions in the code:
- Fingerprint: RX=16, TX=17
- OLED: SDA=21, SCL=22
- Buzzer: Pin=32
- SD Card: CS=33, MOSI=27, MISO=26, SCK=25
- RFID: SS=5, RST=4, MOSI=23, MISO=19, SCK=18

Power Requirements:
==================
- ESP32: 3.3V
- OLED Display: 3.3V
- SD Card Module: 3.3V or 5V (check your module)
- RFID Module: 3.3V
- Fingerprint Sensor: 3.3V or 5V (check your module)
- Buzzer: 3.3V or 5V

Make sure your power supply can handle all components!
