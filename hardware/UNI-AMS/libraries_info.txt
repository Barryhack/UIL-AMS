// Pin Configuration Notes:
/*
CORRECTED PIN ASSIGNMENTS:
- Fingerprint Module: RX=16, TX=17 (using Serial2)
- SD Card MISO: Changed from D27 to D26 (D27 was used for MOSI)
- All other pins remain as specified

WIRING VERIFICATION NEEDED:
- Double-check that MISO and MOSI pins don't conflict
- Ensure power supply can handle all modules
- Verify 3.3V/5V requirements for each module
