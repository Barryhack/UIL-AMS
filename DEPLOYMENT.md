# UNILORIN AMS - Production Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Status: SUCCESSFUL ✅

Your UNILORIN AMS application has been successfully deployed to Render!

## 📋 Next Steps for Production Setup

### 1. Environment Variables Configuration

In your Render dashboard, configure these environment variables:

```bash
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.onrender.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Hardware Integration
HARDWARE_API_KEY=your-hardware-api-key
HARDWARE_SECRET=your-hardware-secret
```

### 2. Database Setup Options

#### Option A: Render PostgreSQL (Recommended)
1. Create a new PostgreSQL service in Render
2. Copy the connection string from the PostgreSQL service
3. Set it as `DATABASE_URL` in your web service

#### Option B: External Database
- Supabase, Railway, or any PostgreSQL provider
- Use the provided connection string

### 3. Database Migration

The application will automatically run migrations on startup. If you need to run them manually:

```bash
# In Render shell or locally
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Initial Data Setup

Create your first admin user and seed data:

```bash
# Run the seed script
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Access Your Application

Once configured, your application will be available at:
`https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
